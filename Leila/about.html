            <div class="text">I got my start in the busy newsroom of an international news wire, where I learned the art of storytelling and the importance of accuracy. In addition to editing, I’ve been a reporter, fact checker, researcher, food writer, and educator.  Lately, I’ve been working with historians and other academics seeking a wider audience for their work. Recent projects include Blood on the River, winner of the 2021 Cundill History Prize and the 2021 Frederick Douglass Book Prize. 

            <br/>  <br/> As an editor, I am curious, thoughtful and empathetic (as a writer, I know the effort it takes to put words on paper). I also work with authors on book outlines and proposals and ghostwriting. I’m a graduate of the University of St. Andrews and I live in Washington, D.C.
