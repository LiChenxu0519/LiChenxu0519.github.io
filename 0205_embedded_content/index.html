                    One day they were having a bet on who can run faster. Rabbit believed he will win Turtle and he used his social media to encourage people see their race.

                    They invited Animal Justice Organization to be the referee, and their race became a breaking news in the Cute Animal Forest. So Animal News reported the whole race in their news website.

                    Modesty makes people progress, and arrogance makes people lag behind. Rabbit didn't win the race because he was too confident about himself. But he definately learned a lesson from it.
